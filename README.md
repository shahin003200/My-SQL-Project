🛒 Grocery Store Management System

📌 Project Overview

The Grocery Store Management System is a relational database project developed using SQL to efficiently manage grocery store operations.
This system organizes data related to products, suppliers, customers, employees, and orders, and generates meaningful business insights through SQL queries.

🎯 Project Objectives
* Design a structured relational database
* Maintain data integrity using primary and foreign keys
* Analyze sales and revenue trends
* Track supplier and employee performance
* Generate actionable business insights

🗂️ Database Schema

The project consists of the following tables:
* Suppliers
* Categories
* Products
* Customers
* Employees
* Orders
* Order_Details

🔗 Relationships
* One Supplier → Supplies many Products
* One Customer → Places many Orders
* One Order → Contains many Order Details
* One Product → Appears in many Order Details
All tables are connected using Primary Keys and Foreign Keys with referential integrity.

🛠️ Technologies Used
* MySQL
* SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)
* Joins
* Aggregate Functions
* Window Functions
* Subqueries
